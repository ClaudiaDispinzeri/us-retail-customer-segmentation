📊 Segmentation and Trend Analysis in U.S. Retail
Geodemographics, Consumer Behavior, and Customer Lifetime Value


🧠 Project Overview:
This project explores advanced customer segmentation and trend analysis techniques to support data-driven decision-making in the U.S. retail sector. Using a real-world dataset from Kaggle (shopping_trends.csv), I investigated four core business questions involving subscription drivers, behavioral clustering, product category affinity, and customer lifetime value (CLV) segmentation.


📌 Key Objectives:
-Identify key predictors of subscription decisions.

-Segment customers based on behavioral and geographic data.

-Map product affinities using clustering techniques.

-Group customers by CLV to support targeted retention strategies.


🛠️ Techniques & Tools:
- Modeling: Logistic Regression, LassoCV, Backward Elimination;

- Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA;

- Evaluation: Elbow Method, Silhouette Score;

- Preprocessing: Dummy encoding, standardization (StandardScaler), geospatial enrichment;

- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, geopy


📍 Geospatial Insights:
Customer segmentation was enhanced using latitude and longitude data, enabling the creation of region-specific clusters that reflect consumption patterns by U.S. state.
